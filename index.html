    <p>To Friendly Neighbourhood Sandesh <br>
    I had planned to do this for your birthday but you had to ruin my plans didn't you. I would say I'm glad that you exist as well. Honestly, everything is too much when it is happening and okay when its in the past.So you are right nikal gaya. Nikal jata hai that's just the way it is. I'm glad that you have some joy in my company because I always hope that you are surrounded by joy.<br>     
    I sincerely hope that you have a life like a fairy tale and a happily ever after, whatever that looks like for you. Remember that you have someone to be there for you whenever you need it. I want want to say thank you. for no reason other than I am grateful for knowing you. <br>

    ps. As nice as your impersonal emails addressed to unknown number of people are, keep in mind outlook is also the same forum where we get quiz marks, assignment emails and fee reminders. Don't make me associate you and them together. I'm pretty sure other ways of messaging exist out there you should try them sometime.
